## What are we doing?
We develop front-end frameworks and UI libraries with the goal of ***transcending boundaries***.

## Projects

### [nuco](https://github.com/nucoui/nuco)

**UI library based on the concept of Transcends Framework boundaries**

nuco is a UI library based on the concept of Transcends Framework boundaries. It is not bound by UIJS frameworks and is guaranteed to work with all frameworks.

Many major UI libraries today only work with specific UI JS frameworks (React, Vue.js). Of course that's fine, and that way you can use the framework APIs to provide more complex functionality. But if you have to change frameworks, you have to let go of those UIs as well. By specifying this library, we can mitigate that risk and completely separate the pure UI logic from the application logic.

### [chatora](https://github.com/nucoui/chatora)

**Transcends Framework boundaries JSX Web Components**

It is a framework that allows you to implement custom elements in a React-like manner. Usually, knowledge of classes is required, but since the implementation is function-based, this knowledge is not necessary!
